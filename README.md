Prediction of phasor FLIM images from fluorescence intensity data from original article "Fluorescence Lifetime Image Microscopy Prediction with Convolutional Neural Networks for Cell Detection and Classification in Tissues", PNAS Nexus, https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac235

Source data from paper can be accessed for free on FigShare (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/FLIM_Image_Files_Masks_and_Classification/21183517).

UNet can be trained to generate phasor-FLIM predictions using the train_unet.py script.
